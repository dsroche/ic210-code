# ic210-code

Welcome to IC210 in Fall 2020!

This directory is a git repository which we will use to send you
starter code and other files needed to complete your assignments,
and you will use to actually write programs and save them.

The "upstream" repository will be updated throughout the
semester with starter code for various assignments. To get the
latest, you can always run `git pull upstream master`.

Many more details are of course available on the course website,
<https://www.usna.edu/Users/cs/roche/courses/f20ic210/>.
